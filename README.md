# Do I Need Typescript
It's an easy questionnaire to help you decide whether you need or not to use typescript.

By answering these questions you get some answers to the question: Do I need typescript for this project? Maybe not and it's just an overhead. Let's use simpler javascript instead. Or maybe the best idea - ever - would be to write the entire thing in typescript. Or rewrite it. It's up to you. I don't mind.
